## 1 - Package description

`ROpenCVLite` is a utility package that installs [`OpenCV`](http://opencv.org/) 
within `R` for use by other packages. This package is not a wrapper around 
`OpenCV` (it does not provide access to `OpenCV` functions in R), not is it a 
computer vision package for R. All it does is compiling and installing OpenCV 
within your R installation so that other packages can easily find it and compile 
against it.

`ROpenCVLite`.
